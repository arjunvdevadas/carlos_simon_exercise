### Questions
Accessions SRR5223500, SRR5223522, SRR5223543 contain RNASeq data of non-treated
cells while SRR5223505, SRR5223547 and SRR5223570 have been treated with a
stimulatory agent. We wish to determine the effect of the stimulatory agent on the
transcriptome of these cells in order to understand its effects on cell differentiation.


1. Perform quality control of the sequence data. Are all samples appropriate to use?
2. Map the reads to a reference, perform QC and calculate gene counts. Are all samples
appropriate to use?
3. What is the expression of gene FOXP3 in stimulated vs non-treated cells?
4. What genes are most differentially expressed between treated and non-treated cells?
